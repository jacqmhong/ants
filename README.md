# Ants

Ants is a project that intends to instill lessons on object-oriented programming: local state, inheritance, composition, overloading, and method lookup. To sum up the functionality of Ants, it is a game where an ant colony is being invaded by bees and the ants must be able to defend themselves and their queen with their implemented abilities, such as throwing leaves at bees, catching bees on fire, eating bees whole, resisting stings, and more. Files include starter code. Personal code lines are marked.

Only the files that resulted in editing are included:
* ants.py
